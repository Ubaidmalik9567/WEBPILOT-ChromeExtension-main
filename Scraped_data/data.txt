Wilfred Arthur (7 December 1919 – 23 December 2000) was a fighter ace and senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. Commonly known as "Woof", he was credited with ten aerial victories and led combat formations at squadron and wing level, becoming the youngest group captain in RAAF history. Arthur first saw action in the Middle East and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four aircraft in a single sortie. He was then posted to New Guinea, where he received the Distinguished Service Order for continuing to lead an attack after discovering his guns were inoperable. As wing leader of No. 71 Wing, he was severely burned in a runway collision. Upon recovery, he was posted to the Dutch East Indies and played a leading part in the Morotai Mutiny when eight RAAF officers attempted to resign. Following his discharge, he pursued business interests in Australia and Vietnam before settling in Darwin, Northern Territory. (Full article...)

The Ugandan kob (Kobus kob thomasi) is a subspecies of the kob, a type of antelope. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa, in South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ugandan kob is distinguished from other kob subspecies by its reddish-brown colour. It is similar in appearance to the impala but is more sturdily built. Only the males have horns, which are lyre-shaped, strongly ridged and divergent. Males are slightly larger than females, being 90 to 100 centimetres (3.0 to 3.3 ft) at the shoulder, with an average weight of 94 kilograms (207 lb), while females are 82 to 92 centimetres (2.7 to 3.0 ft) at the shoulder and on average weigh about 63 kilograms (139 lb). This photograph shows two Ugandan kobs mating in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda.
